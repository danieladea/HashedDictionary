CS 32 assignment to store and lookup anagrams of words

This was a project to create a data structure to lookup anagrams of an inputted word in an efficient manner.
I chose to use a hashtable to make accessing elements very fast. 
Testing clocked this program at an average speed of 5 ms and it had to be under 8 ms to get an A.
